# COP4600-Operating-system
Description
-----------------
This course teaches the design and internal workings of computer operating systems. It covers concepts, principles, mechanisms, policies, functionality, design tradeoffs, and implementation of systems that support concurrent processing. This is not a theoretical operating system course that focuses only on concepts. It is primarily a hands-on learning experience which centers around an actual operating system that we work with, understand in details, modify and build.

Project
------------------
This team project involves writing a command interpreter for a Korn shell-like command language in C using Lex and Yacc running under Unix. The shell will parse command lines and execute the appropriate command(s). The core of the shell consists of simple commands, pipes, I/O redirection, environment variables, aliases, pathname searching, and wild-carding. You will do well on the lab if these features work well in the shell. For extra credit, implement tilde expansion and automated command completion. Each requirement in the core section will be explained in the rest of this handout. Lex and Yacc were used for this project.
